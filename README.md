### Predict the Duration of Clientâ€™s Subscription to Improved Forecast Cashflow using Survival  Analysis

The aim of this analysis is to estimate the time to which a customer will cancel their subscription. I have shown that there is an 80% chance that a customer's subscription lasts for approximately 9 months and a 40% chance they last for around 25 months. I demonstrate that larger clients are less likely to cancel at any given time after the first 12 months than smaller ones. Also, the 'Number of Active Users' has the greatest positive impact in predicting the probablity of a customer cancelling and total logins of 500 increases the probablity of survival above the baseline.

I recommend we should drive engagement through number of active users and total logins in the first 9 months to increase the chances of survival. In addition, we can decide our strategy based on what we know our largest risks to cashflow are; whether that be focusing on increasing the probablity of survival for larger customer types because they are of highest value or because smaller clients have a lower probabalitiy of surivival at any given time past 12 months.

### Predict Which Clients will Cancel Subscription to help Account Managers Reduce Churn using Logistic Regression

In this project I use Logistic Regression to predict which clients will cancel and evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness. The model shows 80% accuracy. However, we must be cautious that the high accuracy scores are a result of the active default predictions as oppose to the model being able to effective map a relationship between the variables used and the account status. This lead us to control for the imbalance in account status which generated a much more positive confusion matrix, despite the lower accuracy score.

### Predict Which Clients will Cancel Subscription to help Account Managers Reduce Churn using KNN

I find the optimal k is 18, therefore given new data the model will look to the closest 18 customers to each new customer and predict a value for account status (active or inactive) from the most frequently observed value from those 18 with 79.5% accuracy each time.

### What insights can we get from our ticket service data?

Analysing ticket service data I show that 40% of our clients use the ticket function and the average number of tickets we receive on a monthly basis is 640. I indentify 89 clients that sent an above average number of tickets in the time period, which accounted for 74% of all tickets received in the period. 

This will help the ticket service team manage their workload, and explore options like looking to manage expectations of response times to clients sending in above average tickets, or limit the amount of tickets to make sure that the amount we receive per ticket doesn't drop below a certain threshold if the efforts of the team would be more valuable else where.

### With over 8,000 pages on our website, which pages should we enrich first to make the biggest impact to our user's experience?

I analyse the pageviews on our content pages and recommend that we focus our time on enriching 18.9% of our UK national, business and consumer pages on our website, as these are the pages with views above the average for the respective page types, and therefore of most interest to our users.

Ensuring that these 1,601 pages contain full, up to date and accurate content we will be impacting nearly 82% of the total views on our UK pages in the last 4 months. This recommendation was put into practice by the CEO and now 'Project 1,600' looks to frequently review the data on these pages.

### Data Cleaning and Visualisation to Give Insights Into Cancelling Clients

I give insights into both our live and cancelled clients, our cancellation rate is low at 22.2% of our entire client base. I show that cancelled clients more frequently have 'mid' or 'low' engagement and usage at the time of their cancellation request, and that more clients cancel their subscriptions in year 1 than any other year. Finally, when we consider the reason the client gave at the time of cancellation I show that 50% or more in each year state there is no longer a requirement for our service. Considering all of these insights I recommend that we review our current processes with the Account Managers with all of the above in mind, points to consider are: 

- Our onboarding process - Do we give enough training? Extra 1 on 1 sessions with people that will use it everyday (superusers). Or 'top up' training sessions throughout the subscription.
- First year check ins - Can we call first year clients more regularly to see how the subscription is going? This will enable Account Managers to gauge more of an idea of the interaction and change the client status as an indicator. 
- Marketing campaigns - Should we create a campaign for all first year users to drive top tips, short how to videos, alerts of new functionality to drive engagement?
- Our service desk - Should we prioritise our first year client incoming queries above others? This would ensure wait times for feedback are lower for first year clients.
